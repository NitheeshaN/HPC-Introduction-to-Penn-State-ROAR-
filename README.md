This workshop includes a detailed introduction on how to use a High Performance Computing system (HPC). I introduce what an HPC is and how to submit batch jobs to the Penn State HPC. This includes instructions on how to code using BASH, formatting sh files and how to use external file transfer systems. Though some instructions are specific to the Penn State ROAR HPC, the majority of these procedures can be used for submitting jobs on any HPC system. Please contact me with any questions, thank you!
